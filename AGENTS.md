# AGENTS.md

Template namespace plugin for Craft CMS 5 (PHP 8.2+).

## Code

- Design for real Craft behavior. Adapt tests to the architecture, not the other way around.
- Use code comments sparingly. Comment only what the code can't say, and keep the wording precise and concise.

- Respect the architecture rules in `deptrac.yaml` and `tests/PHPStan`.

## Checks

- Iterate with focused checks, e.g. `composer test -- --filter=…` or `composer phpstan`.
- Run `composer check` before finishing. It covers style, refactoring, static analysis, architecture, dependencies, tests, 100% coverage and mutation testing.
- Auto-fix with `composer ecs-fix`, `composer rector-fix` and `composer composer-normalize-fix`.
- Never weaken a check to make it pass: no new ignores, baselines or lowered thresholds. Fix the cause.

## Docs

- The docs site lives in `docs/` (Astro Starlight, deployed to Cloudflare with Void) in a pnpm workspace driven by Vite+.
- Check it with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm build`; auto-fix with `pnpm fix`.
- Keep the `docs/` pages in line with the README and the code. Add new pages to the sidebar in `docs/astro.config.js`.

## Git

- Commit only when asked.
- Use Conventional Commits, e.g. `refactor: simplify namespace registration`.
- Don't add AI attribution such as co-author trailers or generated-by footers.
